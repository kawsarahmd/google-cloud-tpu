# Project Setup for JAX on TPUs

This guide provides instructions for setting up the necessary environment to run JAX on TPUs, along with additional libraries for neural network construction and optimization. You can follow these instructions in environments such as Kaggle Notebooks or Google Colab.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install several packages including JAX for TPUs, Flax, Optax, TensorFlow (CPU version), and SciPy. Use the following commands to install these packages:

```bash
# Install JAX with TPU support
!pip install --upgrade "jax[tpu]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html

# Install Flax, Optax, TensorFlow (CPU-only version), and SciPy
!pip install flax optax tensorflow-cpu scipy
